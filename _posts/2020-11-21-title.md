Hello hello! Among Us is a fun game but I fell asleep and missed my server's game :( Oh well we have 70 members so there's always someone to fill up the gaps. I should do webhooks sometime. Wouldn't that be fun? I made one today with Zapier, so tht it pings the Discord server every time 5up tweets something. I'm proud of it.
